## Description 
The goal of this project was to create an application that allows a manager for an internet retail company that allows them to organize their e-commerce website by creating and viewing products, categories, and tags.

## Installation
View this video to see how to run this application: https://youtu.be/_tU5i1DSsIs

## Usage
To use this application, edit the '.env.EXAMPLE' file to include your login information, and rename the file to just '.env'. Run the schema.sql file found in the db directory in the Mysql shell by using the command 'source db/schema.sql' to create the database on your machine. Next you will need to seed the database, which can be done with 'npm run seed'. The server can now be run with the command 'npm start'. Using the Insomnia Core, you will be able to make requests for categories, products, and tags.
